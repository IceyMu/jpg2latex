Python script for compiling images into a single pdf using latex.

Usage:
    jpg2latex [options]

Options:
    -h, --help                      Show help.
    -v, --verbose                   Give output about the program's operation.
    -q, --quiet                     Give no output about the program's operation.
    -c, --cleanup                   Remove temporary files such as latex source file and resized images.
    -nc, --no-cleanup               Disables cleanup of temporary files.
    -s, --sort                      Sort images alphabetically in pdf output
    -ns, --no-sort                  Disable automatic sorting of images
    -d, --dir, --directory <path>   Get images from the provided path, default is the current directory.
    -n, --name <name>               Name for the pdf output, default is name of the image directory.
    -r, --resize, --ratio <float>   Amount to scale resolution by, for example a value of 0.5 will scale
                                    a 100x100 source image to 50x50 in the pdf.
    -jq, --quality, --jpeg-quality <int>
                                    Sets the quality of the jpeg compression, value should be in [1, 95].
    -a, --angle <float>             Sets the angle in degrees to rotate the images by in the pdf, a
                                    value of 270 represents no rotation.
    -f, --formats <extensions>      Give file extensions of image formats to use from the source
                                    directory non case sensitive and does not need to be prefixed with a
                                    '.' supported file extensions are jpg and png.

Default options:
    Default options are read from the file defaults.txt which must be written in the following format.

    Each line must start with verbose, cleanup, resize, quality, angle, or formats. That line will then
    set the default value for the corresponding option. Only one option per line.

    Each option must be included and followed by their value and separated by whitespace.

    To set verbose and cleanup to false you must write false for their value (non case-sensitive)

    Example:
        verbose true
        cleanup true
        sort    true
        resize  0.5
        quality 85
        angle   270
        formats jpg png
